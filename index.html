          <h1>2013–2015: Career beginnings and Karate.</h1>      
          <p>Anne-Marie cut a solo demo for Rocket Records in 2013 called "Summer Girl". Her solo career was curtailed for her to develop herself as an artist; in the interim, she guested on tracks by Magnetic Man, Gorgon City and Raized by Wolves, after which she caught the attention of Rudimental; one of their vocalists left, and so they asked Anne-Marie to replace her. She featured on four tracks on their album We the Generation, of which two were co-features with Dizzee Rascal and Will Heard;the latter, "Rumour Mill", reached number 67 on the UK Singles Chart.</p>
        </div>
        <p>She spent two years touring alongside them. On 10 June 2015, Anne-Marie released her debut EP Karate, which went out on the new label Major Tom's; two singles were released from it, "Karate" and "Gemini", which led to Anne-Marie making her first solo live performances. That November she released "Do It Right", which peaked at number 90 on the UK Singles Chart. It was originally intended to appear on Anne-Marie's debut full-length album, which at the time, had the working title of Breathing Fire.</p>
